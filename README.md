Welcome!  
This repository is part of my journey to learn and practice coding. I am studying programming and using this project to improve my skills, especially in web development. Here, I am building and experimenting with recipes as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Activities

- Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics  
- Creating and styling recipe web pages  
- Practicing version control with Git and GitHub  
- Documenting my progress and sharing my work

## About

This project helps me apply what I learn and track my growth as a developer.  
Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my learning process!
